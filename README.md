# 2D-Monte-Carlo-Simuation-for-Compton-Scattering

The programme is designed for Compton scattering experiments to model the interaction of photons with matter in a 2D space. In a simulation, it generates a large number of random events based on statistical distributions, including positions and direction of the photons before scattering. These statistical distributions model the photon beam as a line source, where a line source was split into several segments and each segment was assigned to emit radiation in the positive x direction and being oriented around the x-axis with an angle $\theta$ where $\theta$ follows a Gaussian distribution. 

A diagram of the random trajectories of photons in one simulation is shown in the following:
